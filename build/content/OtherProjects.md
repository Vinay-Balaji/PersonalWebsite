## Chess GUI
In my Computing Fundamentals class, I worked on an interactive two-player chess game using pygame. The game includes specific attacks for each chess piece, automatic detection of checks and checkmates, and pawn promotion to queen. It also features an end screen displaying checkmate when a player wins.

## SoccerBots
In my engineering class, we designed two remote-controlled RC cars with Arduino, named Lightning and Sally, to mimic Rocket League for kids at the Boston Childrenâ€™s Museum. The cars had custom-built chassis, were laser-cut with acrylic, and wirelessly controlled with joysticks. They featured a distance sensor that detected when the soccer ball entered the goal, triggering an LED light-based scoring system. We used nRF24L01 wireless transceiver technology to transmit joystick coordinates to the car and custom-built the joystick with an Arduino.

## FloodIt Java Application
This is a Java application of the game FloodIt. The goal is to flood the board with one color in limited clicks. Adjacent squares are flooded in a waterfall effect and clicking a square already the same color does not flood. Difficulty is proportional to board size and colors available. Players lose if they fail to flood the board within the allotted clicks, and win if they succeed. Players can reset the game by pressing 'r'.

## Maze Generation and Pathfinder
I built a Java application that utilizes Kruskal's algorithm to generate random mazes of up to 100 by 100. Users can customize the size of the maze, making it a highly interactive experience. In addition, I implemented automated depth-first and breadth-first searches to visually solve the mazes and retrace the solution path.

## Braille UNO Cards
I worked on a project to make UNO cards more accessible for individuals who are blind or have vision impairments. We used laser cutting to etch Braille numbers on each card, and created an interactive box for easy locating. The project was a success, and I was thrilled to make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

## Smart Tile
I created a smart tile that generates electricity from footsteps using piezoelectric disks. The prototype compresses onto the disk when stepped on, producing electrical current. My team and I also developed a pitch deck explaining how the tile solves a problem. See the attached slideshow for more information.
