## About
Hi there! My name is Vinayajitesh Balaji, but most people call me Vinay. I am a Computer Engineering and Computer Science major at Northeastern that is constantly seeking to learn new technical skills. I am passionate about new technologies and robotics, and have discussed these topics on my podcast the Tech Check. With my skills, I strive to improve human lives with robotics and programming. When I am not immersed in technology, I love to play pickup basketball, football, chess, and gaming!
