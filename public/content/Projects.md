## Citizens Bank (July 2023 - July 2024)
During my one-year tenure as a Software Engineer at Citizens Bank, I focused on enhancing and streamlining automation processes within the organization. I successfully integrated Python into UiPath workflows, laying the groundwork for Generative AI enhancements in banking automations. I developed an enterprise-wide PTO automation system that seamlessly adds approved colleague PTO to both the system and Outlook calendar, improving organizational efficiency. My efforts also included crafting and deploying over 25 UiPath libraries, which significantly enhanced development efficiency and standardization for our RPA team. I led the integration of UiPath processes with Bitbucket, converting more than 40 automations to align with CI/CD pipeline protocols. Additionally, I crafted SQL queries to extract data on over 400 BluePrism automations, facilitating their streamlined transition to UiPath. I manually transitioned more than 15 BluePrism processes to UiPath using VBScript, ensuring a seamless operational workflow. Furthermore, I engaged in end-to-end automation process mapping using Lean Six Sigma methodologies for commercial business lines, optimizing processes and enhancing productivity across the board.

## HyperTrader
During this internship, I developed and maintained React Native components, screens, and features for HyperTrader’s app with Test-Driven Development. In addition, I created interactive components using React Native, such as buttons, unique text components, checkboxes, search bars, and nav bars. This internship also taught me how to utilize Redux to manage various states, actions, and reducers in HyperTrader’s mobile application. For HyperTrader's hotlist page I retrieved market-pairs data from Binance API and integrated this data into an easy to read hotlist flex-table. From the Binance API, I was able to pull the current price, price change, volume, and their respective symbol. Finally, I participated in daily standup meetings regarding feature implementation and git management such as merging code, rebasing, branching, git CLI, and resolving merge conflicts.
