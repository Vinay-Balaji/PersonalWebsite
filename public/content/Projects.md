## HyperTrader
During this internship, I developed and maintained React Native components, screens, and features for HyperTrader’s app with Test-Driven Development. In addition, I created interactive components using React Native, such as buttons, unique text components, checkboxes, search bars, and nav bars. This internship also taught me how to utilize Redux to manage various states, actions, and reducers in HyperTrader’s mobile application. For HyperTrader's hotlist page I retrieved market-pairs data from Binance API and integrated this data into an easy to read hotlist flex-table. From the Binance API, I was able to pull the current price, price change, volume, and their respective symbol. Finally, I participated in daily standup meetings regarding feature implementation and git management such as merging code, rebasing, branching, git CLI, and resolving merge conflicts
